I'm ~~a dragon lost in the human world~~ trying to find a balance between research and engineering. I do machine learning by day and build things for the web by night.

- 🔭 Research-wise, I'm interested in machine learning (enhancing generalizability, efficiency, robustness, etc.) and computer vision (large multimodal models, generative models, etc.).
- 🚀 I'm learning to build machine learning software and systems.
- 👩‍💻 My personal website is [sandidsisir](https://sandidsisir.github.io). It's simple and serious, much like those of other researchers.
- 👾 Currently interested in building things in *Minecraft*.
- 🌭 My dream: `while(sleeping){money++;}`
